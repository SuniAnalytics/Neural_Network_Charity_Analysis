# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

  Goal of the project is to assist alphabet soup's business team to make an informed decision on which organization predict whether application will succeed if funded by Alphabet Soup. 
  
  Source Data: History of all 34K organization that received funding over the years.
  
  Objective is to analyse the data set and build a machine learning, nueral network model with high accuracy to provide predictions.
  

## Results

* Data Processing

   * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
     - IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target variable for the model
     
   * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
      - Application Type, Affiliation, use case, Income Amt etc are the features of the model
   
   * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
     - Few variables like EIN and NAME are dropped from the dataset


* Compiling, Training and Evaluating the model

   * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
   * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
   * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary 

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
